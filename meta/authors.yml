    introduction: "While I may not have any answers about life and meaning, what can
      it hurt to share glimpses of slivers of tiny fractions of what
      dreams.thoughts.ideas have sometimes come with others, such as yourself,
      along the road, in the wild hope that some reflection, refraction,
      remembrance, redirection, recollection, redefinition, or revolution may
      trip or bound across the expanse from heart to heart or mind to being for
      a brief but bloody brilliant millisecond, binding us in a flash, then
      fading away so quickly that we neither of us are sure that anything at all
      happened but we share a small smile and go on about our way? "
