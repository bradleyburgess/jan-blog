## Where Will You Go?



![](/images/f9a81a64-b925-4300-ac88-6da12a5d8a34.jpeg)

I’ve heard the term “faith crisis” used to describe what happens to people who
leave the church. I would not call my journey a crisis. I think I just grew up.

I did not plan it, I did not seek it, and I didn’t live in a way to “invite” it
into my life in the way church members may use the term. Most church members
will know what I mean by that. On the inside, it’s very easy to believe,
without questioning, that people who leave are somehow not living up to the
standards set by the church, somehow failing in their duty, or especially that
they have “sins”of which they have not repented that cause them to leave.
That’s simply not true. That’s a way to dismiss people and label them as
“unworthy”[^1] so that we don’t have to think about what their genuine concerns may
be.

Here is a condensed version of my thoughts and feelings over the past 8 or more
years. I definitely have to credit serving a mission[^2] with awakening a desire for
a more sincerely compassionate life and for opening my mind. If any of this
seems judgemental, please realize that I was part of it, too, and that’s what I
could no longer accept.

1. FOCUS. I felt that we were facing inwards like cattle and kicking out.
2. DIVISION. Church v. other churches. Church v. the world. Church v. change.
   The division of “faithful” and “less active” or “inactive” members. Members.
   Really listen to that. Some are members. They are “in”. Others are referred
   to as non-members. In the church, it is a matter of course to label people by
   what they are not, according to our standard. My own family was split down
   made-up lines of “member” and “non-member.” That felt more and more
   uncomfortable to me over time.
3. GENUINE CONNECTION. While there were two or three experiences a year where I
   felt that discussions at church were open, sincere, and connected
   interactions, heartfelt discussions nearly always went “back to the manual”.
   It was less likely that we would sit with our feelings, more likely we would
   gloss over them. There is little empathetic listening when vulnerability
   happens. Most often we find a way to a. tie it back to the manual or b. to
   placate, rather than to really sit with the discomfort.
4. PROGRAMME. If we felt uninspired in meetings, we were at fault. Not the
   manual, not the pre-approved topics, not the mode of delivery, not the often
   out-of-touch messages. The people were to fit in with the programme, that was
   clear. This was the case with music. No matter how dreary it was, we had to
   stick to the approved programme and hymns. I cannot think of a good reason
   why it was all so limited. Follow the spirit, but not if it inspires you to
   go outside the prescriptions.
5. THE M*RMON MOLD. The type of family that we were all supposed to aspire to
   seemed comically over-simplified. Instead, I observed genuinely amazing
   people who felt like terrible failures for not living up to something that
   was called God’s standard for family. One of many[^3] side-effects is that
   the church has droves of incredible single people feeling less-than. That may
   have been the SINGLE (excuse the pun) MOST BIZARRE thing I witnessed. They
   had everything before them, but felt they had nothing before them. Why?
   Simply because they were not married with children.[^4] There was depression,
   self-recrimination, bad marriages entered into due to sheer desperation, etc.
   I observed this in church on three continents over a decade - a pattern, not
   an anomaly.
6. SHAME. It eventually dawned on me that this was a red flag. While Dieter
   Uchtdorf (a high church official) may have given an impassioned talk[^5] about
   not using manipulation to get people to do what you want them to do, the
   church is built on a lot of the tactics he denounced. In one breath, a
   sincere leader would warn against manipulation; with the next, another,
   equally sincere leader would use manipulative language towards the members -
   creating fear about losing blessings, losing their faith, losing their
   families, losing their eternities - seemingly without noticing the
   contradiction. It’s not “the people”. It’s baked into the system.
7. CHOICE. We would speak of freedom of choice, God’s plan that we should all be
   free to choose. Then, we would talk about the specific things we were limited
   to choosing - the small sampling of thoughts, ideas, actions and experiences
   we were allowed to have in life. You may call that the strait and narrow path
   to God. I call it something else. God’s plan of freedom to choose started
   looking a great deal like Satan’s plan to force us to do things (as taught by
   the LDS church, at least). Agency has always been a key principle. That
   seemed to erode over time. It morphed into “the freedom to do what leaders
   say is right” rather than the freedom to follow the dictates of your
   conscience and work out your life yourself (which are scriptural principles).

   a. I can’t get into it fully here, but shame is routinely used to make
   people afraid of making choices that go contrary to church teachings. Fear
   of what will happen - to you or your loved ones - is part of shaming people
   into choosing what leaders want for them rather than what they know is
   right for them. Shame on you for feeding your family rather than paying
   tithing. Shame on you for turning down that guy you should have married.
   Shame on you for saying no to a calling because you’re over-stretched. Your
   blessings are at stake.

   b. The population of this planet is endlessly varied - different cultures,
   genders, experiences, orientations, expressions, preferences, needs,
   motives. That variation is treated as wrong. You’d have to believe that
   God created diversity only so that he could then hate it and ask us to
   conform to one idea. Or, I suppose, that conformity was always the goal and
   diversity is the huge crime of humanity?! Hence, the making bland and
   whitewashing of individuality. I found that astonishing once I allowed
   myself to think of it.
8. INFORMATION CONTROL. This was a subtle drift, as leaders placed more and more
   emphasis on church sources of information as opposed to any and all other
   sources - yet another danger signal. I observed what I considered the
   “dumbing down” of church manuals. More and more reliance on leaders was
   encouraged, prescriptiveness of a level I hadn't experienced in my early
   church life.[^6] What the leaders say has been placed above what your own heart,
   your own needs, or your own common sense might suggest.
9. CHURCH ESSAYS. What can I say more?[^7]
10. NO STRINGS ATTACHED GOODNESS. I felt a strong need within myself to be good
    for goodness’ sake. I wanted to give from my heart, not because my good
    standing in the group would be affected if I didn’t (I tried to explain this
    to my bishop on one of my last Sundays). Anyone associated with the church
    knows the teaching: do what is right, let the consequence follow. Rewards
    await the faithful and “bad” choices will have bad consequences. It’s about
    wanting blessings and wanting God to come good on your eternal account.
    Perhaps other church members hear those messages differently than I do, but
    I could no longer overlook or excuse it in myself.

## Two Roads Diverged In A Wood

And so a fork appeared in the road ahead. Members of the church may say that at
the crossroads the choice is simply to allow faith to win and to find ways to
make peace with all the things I’ve written about (and, let me tell you, what
I’ve written is not even an hundredth part).

The thing is, though, I actually believed in freedom to choose. That lesson
proved stronger than the lesson to be afraid. I walked out of church one Sunday
knowing I wasn’t going back the following week. To my mind, fear lost that day
and faith won, not the other way around.

I left with a simple idea: If I put all my beliefs down and strip away all the
expectations of people and the supposed expectations of deity, and I eventually
find what I left behind to be good and right after consideration, I can just
pick it all up again! There is grace enough for that. There is grace enough for
that.

What happened:

1. I found that I didn’t miss running around being righteous. It appeared more
   shallow on the outside than it had even appeared on the inside.
2. I found that my connection to something higher than myself did not suffer.
   After a period of fearfulness, I could still feel like myself - connected,
   full, whole, unruffled. That was not connected to church attendance and
   adherence.
3. I connected way better than before to people in my life outside of the
   church.
4. I could let my desire to accept and love others as they are flourish, instead
   of having to filter it through the church lens.
5. I talked with my mother about my faith journey and got nothing but love,
   acceptance, and pride from her. Her story with the church is her own to tell.
   She’s the best person I know.
6. I found that there weren’t people in the church with whom I could talk about
   this. Perhaps there are those who would rather guess what’s going on with me,
   or attempt to divine “by the spirit” what is going on. One person asked me
   directly.
7. After many, many months I finally felt brave enough to really look at the
   church organization, to read unbiased materials, and to think about it with
   an objectivity I couldn’t have had when I was physically participating. I
   will not describe the sickness and betrayal I felt.
8. I eventually realized that my siblings across the pond were going through a
   similar transition. We had never talked about our faith “crises” to one
   another, but here we were, coming to the same conclusions. This was an
   amazing discovery, as it meant that I was not alone.
9. I started to think about church friends who had come and gone and whether
   they had ever experienced similar things. I realized that I had never asked.
10. I accepted that though I had started with the intention of perhaps going
    back if I wanted, that was never going to be an option ever again.
11. Wholesale upheaval aside, I was doing well in my life. I was still me, but
    felt more free to grow, live, and love. There was no longer a box. I
    appreciated that very much.

## Now What? Part One: Church Considerations

### People

To my church friends and acquaintances, please accept my thanks for the role you
have played in my life and the joy and goodness we’ve managed to have together.
Thank you for the music and the friendships. None of this changes any of that. I
am able to hold both my church self and my current self in my hands with respect
and dignity. I’m grateful for much of what we’ve shared, and will remain
grateful always.

I have no issue with church members and wish every single one of you if you’re
reading this really well. I expect nothing from you except for you to be you.
I’m sure that if I walked in at the chapel doors, I’d feel quite as at home as
before. It’s part of my life.

I know how this works and that you may feel the need to avoid me. You must do as
you see fit. I understand that in practice the organization comes first; that’s
what most people adhere to.

If you want to remain my friend, great. I’m glad!!! Yes, you can still be my
friend and invite me to your life events, if you want. Yes, I am able to hold
conversations with people that aren’t about church at all. No, I don’t judge
you for staying or being in the church.

I do not take this lightly. This is what I (thought I) knew and loved for a long
time. It is also what bound me to a community of people I still love.

### Organization

Though I am aware that according to the church I am still a member, still on the
records, and still under the authority of my church leaders, I do not consider
myself a member of the church.

I’m aware that local church leaders may feel responsible for me, may believe
they have jurisdiction over my life, and may attempt to exercise authority in
some way or another. I wish they wouldn’t, but they might. I haven’t heard one
word from any of my church leaders since I walked away 2 years ago.

What bound me to my covenants was my sincerity in making them, full of faith and
trust. Symbolically, I entered into a marriage; as it happens, the person who
performed the marriage wasn’t a marriage officer even though they claimed to be
the one and only legitimate marriage officer in the town. The contract is void -
and not because of me.

The church survives because the people on the ground level are often genuinely
kind and caring, and they are the face of the church. Unfortunately, they are
unwittingly a front for a corporation which is knowingly dishonest and has been
since the beginning. The same could be said for many other christian
organizations, I suppose. This one happens to boldly claim to be nothing at all
like the rest.

I don’t lay blame on members for what isn’t their fault. I simply can’t go back
to an organization that does not own its true past or allow people to make an
informed choice before they join the church. People give their lives, their
time, their biggest life decisions, their money, their efforts, and their
children to the church. They do so in faith and hope. The least they deserve is
honesty.

I owe it to myself to tell my story without shame or hiding. What is there to
hide or protect? That I grew up in a community of (mostly) fabulous people? That
I left for my own reasons? That I now know I can’t return because the
organization is essentially conning a few million people with a well-told but
scrubbed clean story?

All I know is that I’m glad I grew in a way that allowed me to take a step away
so that I could eventually see what was happening. I’m also grateful that it
meant I could follow my heart and live my life on my own terms, according to the
dictates of my own conscience. My sense of morality comes from within.

## Now What? Part Two: The Business of Life

I’m genuinely not sure anyone is interested in how I currently view life or even
if anyone has read this far down.

After a life devoted to beliefs that chose me as a child, and which I chose as a
teenager, I now choose to have no specific set of beliefs.

Shared belief is what allows us to function together on a practical level as
diverse humans across the world, and that’s a marvellous thing. When those
beliefs become too narrow and prescriptive, division rather than cohesion is the
result, perhaps because there’s no space to hold with grace the diversity of
life in such a narrow framework.

In short,\
I would rather live in a spirit of oneness than a spirit of separation.\
If pushed I might go so far as to say I believe in the oneness of everyone and everything.\
And that life is the dancer and I am the dance.

At least I have the hope that a choice to lean into oneness as an ideal will
perhaps allow me to do more good than harm by the time I go the way of all the
earth.

Life and death appear to me to be akin. Both are certifiably sure, equally
terrible and glorious. I neither pretend to understand nor seek to overthrow
either. It is what it is.

I looked at the ocean not long ago and said, “I’m content that the waves crash
and don’t need them to be crashing for me.”

And I felt that it was good.

[^2]: Kenya Nairobi Mission 2012-2013. I won the Mission President and wife
  roulette and I’ll always be grateful for those wonderful people. Upon
  reflection, being endowed before the mission and expecting to grow as a human
  being because of it probably did a lot of the heavy lifting of opening my
  mind. I sincerely thought that growth was coming and I was prepared to follow
  where it led. It led me out.

  pressures can have in people’s lives.
[^4]: I have gay friends in the church who don’t belong because this kind of
  family is not possible for them. Other religious friends from conservative
  communities say they’ve felt a similar pressure to not only have but want a
  “traditional” nuclear, family. Insisting that this is the only way is negating
  most people’s actual lived experience - myself included.

  Uchtdorf was fighting a losing battle, but kudos to him for actually
  attempting. We all know how that turned out
[^6]: I do NOT remember church being like this in the 90s and early 2000s!
  Magazine articles dealt with more fascinating subjects; they were more meaty
  as I recall. Has the development of the internet had anything to do with
  narrowing the scope of church materials and doubling down on the call to
  follow leaders rather than listening to others? I find it all disturbing.
