First, this is a story about my own growth as a human - breathing in and out enough times to evolve and become aware. Second, it is a story about how that natural change as a person interacted with my religious life. I’ll speak in as general terms as I can, in the hope that readers at all stages of breathing in and out and becoming aware can follow it. 

I’ve heard the term “faith crisis” used to describe what happens to people who leave the church or religion. I would not call my journey a crisis. I think I just grew up.

 I did not plan this, I did not seek it, and I didn’t live in a way to “invite” it into my life in the way church members may use the term. On the inside, people who leave are often represented as somehow not living up to the standards set by the church, somehow failing in their duty, or somehow sinful for falling away. That’s simply not true, but it can be used to dismiss people and label them as “unworthy” so that we don’t have to think about what their genuine concerns may be.

Here is a condensed version of my thoughts and feelings with regards to church over the past 8 or more years. I definitely have to credit serving as a missionary for the church (about 8 years ago) with awakening a desire in me to live a more sincerely compassionate life and opening my mind. If any of this seems judgemental, please realize that I was part of it, too, and that’s what I could no longer accept.

1. FOCUS. I felt that we were facing inwards like cattle and kicking out. 
2. DIVISION. Church v. other churches. Church v. the world. Church v. change. The division of “faithful” and “inactive” members. **Members**. Really listen to that. Some are members. They are “in”. Others are referred to as non-members. My own family was split into “members” and “non-members” which I came to realize was unhelpful and nonsensical. 
3. CONNECTION. While there were a few experiences a year where we had discussions at church that were open, sincere, and **connected** interactions, heartfelt discussions always went “back to the manual”, back to the script. If we felt uninspired in meetings, we were at fault. Not the manuals, not the pre-approved topics, not the mode of delivery, not the often out-of-touch messages. The people were to fit in with the programme. It’s like there was a barrier we couldn’t get past, beyond which there was some truth or vulnerability, a deeper level of honesty with one another. In my experience, we rarely got there. I say that as a learner and as a teacher. 
4. THE IDEAL FAMILY. The type of family that we were all supposed to aspire to seemed comically over-simplified the more I observed of life and love. I saw genuinely amazing people who felt like failures for not living up to something that was called God’s standard for family. Division of families into faithful and not faithful church goers caused such pain in people, to highlight just one example. The church also has droves of **incredible** **single** **people** feeling less-than simply for not being married with children, or for being divorced, as though marriage is the only valid life choice they can make that can please themselves or deity. I’m aware that conservative societies tend to favour and push marriage and family, so the church is not alone in that. I observed this obsession  (not too strong a term) with marriage play out in the church on three different continents. What I didn’t see was that people who followed this path were overwhelmingly happy and godly or necessarily made great life choices. There was also the looming issue of LGBTQ+ individuals who simply had no way forward in the church, and no way of living up to the “ideal” we all grew up hearing. None of the contortions and shame around family life seemed healthy. 
5. SHAME. While Dieter Uchtdorf (a high church official) may have given an impassioned speech about *not using manipulation* to get people to do what you want them to do, the church routinely uses the tactics he denounced. In one breath, a sincere leader would warn against manipulation; with the next another, equally sincere leader would use manipulative language towards church goers - creating fear about losing blessings, losing their faith, losing their families, losing their eternities - seemingly without noticing the contradiction. Using shame is not a loving practice. 
6. CHOICE. I could not help but notice that freedom to follow your conscience and work out your life for yourself morphed into  freedom “to do what leaders say is right”. It was a subtle shift from what I had been taught as a kid to what I saw being prioritized in the past few years. What church leaders - both local and general - say has been placed above what your own heart, your own needs, or your own common sense might suggest is right for you and your family. 

   a. It is fear and not love that is laced into the constant refrain at church that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">your blessings from God are at stake</span> if you don’t measure up or if you simply choose something different. 

   b. Our varied cultures, genders, experiences, orientations, expressions, preferences, needs, motives and so on are treated as **wrong**.  You’d have to believe that God created diversity only so that he could hate it and ask us to conform to one idea. I found that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">astonishing</span> once I allowed myself to think of it. Making that diversity of thought, need, desire, expression and so on wrong means members only have one choice if they want to stay in the “in group” of the church: they must choose to conform. I told my mom once that I was beginning to see that I might survive another 30 years in the church without incident because I was sort of accepted as I was, but that just wasn’t true for many others and I wasn’t sure if I could accept that anymore, even if I was “safe” on the inside.


7. INFORMATION CONTROL. This was a subtle drift, as the church placed more and more emphasis on church sources of information as opposed to **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">any and all</span>** other sources - which caused alarm bells to ring for me. When I looked at the latest resources that came out particularly for teaching the youth.... I had to wonder why there was so much of a push to stick to “basics” and not to go beyond that. What was being hidden? 
8. CHURCH ESSAYS. The church published essays on certain topics starting in 2013. It’s all there for all to read. 
9. NO STRINGS ATTACHED GOODNESS. I came to want to **be good for goodness’ sake**. I wanted to give from my heart, not because my good standing in the group would be affected if I didn’t. I tried to explain this to my bishop on one of my last Sundays. It’s like I wanted to start over and learn to do good to others for no reason at all. I couldn’t see my way forward on that within the church. 
10. ROOM TO GROW. Ultimately, as I grew older I saw that I had to choose either to live a life of compulsion or to live a life of openness. Church life felt to me like training wheels that were being tightened in place. Would I accept that I was feeling that way or ignore it and double down?

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">TWO ROADS DIVERGED IN A WOOD: </span>

![](/images/7a17e5b5-5b54-4b54-8dc0-5e1099fdf77e.jpeg)

And so a fork appeared in the road ahead. Possibly members of the church would say that at the crossroads the correct choice is simply to allow faith to win and to find ways to make peace with all the things I’ve written about - and, let me tell you, what I’ve written is “not even an hundredth part.” 

The thing is, though, I actually believed in freedom to choose. That lesson proved stronger than the lesson to be afraid. I walked out of church one Sunday knowing I wasn’t going back the following week. 

To my mind, fear lost that day and faith won, not the other way around. 

I left with a simple idea: If I put all my beliefs down and strip away all the expectations of people and the supposed expectations of deity, and I eventually find what I left behind to be good and right **after consideration**, I can just pick it all up again! There is grace enough for that.

There is grace enough for that. 

What happened: 

1. I found that I didn’t miss running around being righteous. It appeared more shallow on the outside than it had even appeared on the inside. 
2. My connection to something bigger/higher than myself did not suffer. After a period of fearfulness, I could still feel connected, full, whole, unruffled. That was not connected to church attendance and adherence.
3. I connected way better than before to people in my life outside of the church.
4. I could let my desire to accept and love others **as they are** flourish, instead of having to filter my experience of them through the church lens. 
5. I talked with my mother about my faith journey and got nothing but love, acceptance and understanding from her. Her story with the church is her own to tell. She’s a remarkable person, a true gem.  
6. I found that there weren’t people in the church with whom I could talk about this. Perhaps there were those who would rather guess what’s going on with me, or attempt to divine “by the spirit” what was going on. Just one church friend asked me directly. 
7. After many, many months I finally felt brave enough to *really* look at the church *<span style="text-decoration:underline;">organization</span>*, to read unbiased materials, and to think about it with an objectivity I couldn’t have had when I was actively participating. I will not describe the sickness and betrayal I felt. 
8. I realized that my siblings across the pond were going through a similar transition. We had never talked about our faith “crises” to one another, but here we were coming to the same conclusions. This was an amazing discovery, as it meant that I was not alone. 
9. I started to think about church friends who had come and gone and whether they had ever experienced similar things. **I realized that I had never asked.** 
10. I accepted that though I had started with the intention of perhaps going back if I wanted that that was no longer an option. Wholesale upheaval aside, I was doing well in my life. I was still me, but felt more free to grow, live, and love. There was no longer a box. I appreciated that very much

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOW WHAT? PART ONE: Church Considerations </span>

![](/images/adf8807d-dd6b-40a6-bb27-b2953c2f5a24.jpeg)

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">People: </span>

To my church friends and acquaintances, please accept my thanks for the role you have played in my life and the joy and goodness we’ve managed to have together. **Thank you for the music** and the friendships. None of this changes any of that. I am able to hold both my church self and my current self in my hands with respect and dignity. I’m grateful for much of what we’ve shared, and will remain grateful always. 

I have no issue with church members and wish every single one of you if you’re reading this really well. I expect nothing from you except for you to be you. I’m sure that if I walked in at the chapel doors, I’d feel quite as at home as before. It’s part of my life. 

I know how this works and that you may feel the need to avoid me. You must do as you see fit. 

If you want to remain my friend, great. I’m glad!!!  

Yes, you can still be my friend and invite me to your life events, if you want. 

Yes, I am able to hold conversations with people that aren’t about church at all. 

No, I don’t judge you for staying or being in the church. 

I do not take this lightly. This is what I (thought I) knew and loved for a long time. It is also what bound me to a community of people I still love. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Organization</span>

As I’ve said, I didn’t start out with the intention to leave the church or religion! I’m glad that in allowing myself to grow I got myself out; I can see now that that’s a good thing. We make changes only when we’re really ready for them. My process was over the course of many years, and now we are here. 

Though I am aware that according to the church I am still a member, still on the records, and still under the “authority” of church leaders, I do not consider myself a member of the church.

I’m aware that local church leaders may feel responsible for me, may believe they have jurisdiction over my life, and may attempt to exercise authority in some way or another. I wish they wouldn’t, but they might.  I haven’t heard one word from any of my church leaders since I walked away for good over 2 years ago. 

What bound me to my commitments in church was my sincerity, faith and trust. What eventually severed that connection for good was not my walking away, but my realization and acceptance that not only was the church not working for me, it was also covering up the truth about its history and its current behaviour.

The church survives because the people on the ground level are often genuinely kind and caring and they are the face of the church. Behind all that, it acts as a corporation, hiding behind the good faith of people to cover lies, half-truths, covers ups, cruelty and corruption. The same could be said for many other christian and other organizations, I suppose. 

I don’t lay blame on members for what isn’t their fault. People give their lives, their time, their biggest life decisions, their money, their efforts, and their children to the church. They do so in faith and hope. The least they deserve is honesty from the organization. 

I’m grateful that I feel free to continue to follow my heart and live my life on my own terms, according to the dictates of my own conscience. I take all the good I can with me. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOW WHAT? PART TWO: The business of Life</span>

![](/images/16b89d42-6971-4813-929b-5d28525e0625.jpeg)

I’m genuinely not sure anyone is interested in how I currently view life or even if anyone has read this far down. 

After a life devoted to beliefs that chose me as a child, and which I chose as a teenager, I now choose to have no specific set of beliefs. 

Shared belief is what allows us to function together on a practical level as diverse humans across the world, and that’s a marvellous thing. When those beliefs become too narrow and prescriptive, division rather than cohesion is the result, perhaps because we are left with no space to hold *with grace* the diversity of life in such a narrow framework. 

In short, 

I would rather live in a spirit of oneness than a spirit of separation.

 If pushed I might go so far as to say I *believe* in the oneness of everyone and everything. 

And that life is the dancer and I am the dance

At least I have hope that a choice to lean into **oneness** as an ideal will perhaps allow me to do more good than harm by the time I go *the way of all the earth.* 

Life and death appear to me to be akin. Both are certifiably sure,  equally terrible and glorious. 

I neither pretend to understand nor seek to overthrow either. 

It is what it is. 

I looked at the ocean not long ago and said, “I’m content that the waves crash and don’t need them to be crashing for me.” 

And I felt that it was good.
